This directory is intentionally left empty, but has to exist since the dockerfile will otherwise not terminate a build. It is used to store local versions of openEASE node modules which should be tested for development. The dockerfile will automatically fetch them, but make sure to place them in the correct place.

## Configuration for node_modules:

At first create an `@openease` directory inside `node_modules` and then clone the repositories of your choice inside that directory (but make sure to follow the instruction below if you do).
  
#### Clone openease_threejs

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/openease_threejs.git canvas-three
```

#### Clone openease_d3

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/openease_d3.git charts
```

#### Clone ros-js-clients

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/ros-js-clients.git ros-clients
```

#### Clone rosprolog-js-console

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/rosprolog-js-console.git rosprolog-console
```

#### Clone JS dependencies to rosprolog-console/@openease

1. create @openease folder inside rosprolog-console 
1. navigate to rospolog-console/@openease
1. execute:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/ros-js-clients.git ros-clients
    ```

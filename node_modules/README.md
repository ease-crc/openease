This directory is intentionally left empty, but has to exist since the dockerfile will otherwise not terminate a build. It is used to store local versions of openEASE node modules which should be tested for development. The dockerfile will automatically fetch them, but make sure to place them in the correct place.

## Configuration for node_modules:

At first create an `@openease` folder inside `node_modules`
  
#### Clone openease_threejs
``` system
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/openease_threejs.git canvas-three
```

#### Clone openease_d3
``` system
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/openease_d3.git charts
```

#### Clone ros-js-clients
``` system
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/ros-js-clients.git ros-clients
```

#### Clone rosprolog-js-console
``` system
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/rosprolog-js-console.git rosprolog-console
```

#### Clone JS dependencies to rosprolog-console/@openease
Create `node_modules/@openease` directories inside `rosprolog-console`. Next, navigate to that folder and execute:
``` system
git clone https://github.com/ease-crc/ros-js-clients ros-clients
```

The final directory structure should look like this:

``` system
        node_modules/
        └── @openease
            ├── canvas-three
            ├── charts
            ├── ros-clients
            └── rosprolog-console
                └── node_modules
                    └── @openease
                        └── ros-clients
```

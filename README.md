[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/navidJadid/openease_flask.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/navidJadid/openease_flask) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/navidJadid/openease_flask/branch/development/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/navidJadid/openease_flask)

Repository which contains the front & back-end code for the openease project.

Cannot be run by itself as of right now. Either build the [whole project](https://github.com/ease-crc/openease) with docker-compose (will pull the most recent docker-build from [`docker-hub`](https://hub.docker.com/r/openease/flask)) or check out the [development project](https://github.com/navidJadid/openease_webserver_development).

Apart from that, tests will of course still run in CI-environment.

**TODO:**
- change coverage badge to follow master instead of development, after merge of pull request
- add version badge
- add license badge

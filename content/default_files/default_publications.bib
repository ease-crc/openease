    abstract = {Industrial and technological innovations constantly call for the development of materials that meet specific and novel requirement profiles. However, the engineering of materials with the desired properties is a time-, cost-, and labor-intensive process as changing the composition and the parameterization of processing steps yields an unimaginably large search space. It is therefore crucial for the future engineering of materials to be conducted in a more goal-directed and more efficient way to generate informative hypotheses revealing particularly promising experiments and thus guiding the exploration process in a more informed fashion. In this paper, we present MatCALO, an intelligent, cognitive assistant system that supports materials scientists in developing novel materials. MatCALO combines modern machine learning techniques with machine-interpretable semantic knowledge in order to model representations of relationships between materials, processes and properties and allow reasoning about them. We showcase a prototypical approach for generating such hypotheses by reverse-querying regression models learned from experimental data. However, a workable set of experiments alone generally does not suffice as it will never cover an adequately large area of the search space, which led us to the conclusion that additional background knowledge is required to build more reliable models. The readers can assure themselves of the feasibility of this approach by testing the web-based interface using the MatCALO system which will be made available to the broad community. Given a requirement profile, the system generates hypotheses on how these criteria can be achieved.}

	for human beings to use natural language concepts, e.g. mountainlake,

	for Information Systems) combines well-known methods and techniques

	of images in a textual form automatically. The text retrieval is
	done by IBM SearchManager for AIX. The system is implemented on IBM2

	and object recognition. Objects and regions in an image can be distinguished
	by their texture, where the distinction arises from the different
	physical surface properties of the objects represented. To a human
	observer the different textures in an image are usually very apparent,
	but the verbal description of the visual properties of these patterns
	is a difficult and ambiguous task. In computer vision it has turned
	out in theoretical and experimental comparisons of different methods
	that the co-occurrence matrix is suitable for texture analysis. Therefore,
	in this approach the co-occurrence matrix is used as a mathematical
	model for natural textures. We propose a promising improvement for
	texture classification and description in the context of natural
	textures. After developing a new abstract language for describing
	visual properties of natural textures, we establish a relation between
	these visual properties used by a human observer, and statistical
	textural features computed out of the digital image data. Our experiments
	indicate that some statistical features are more significant for
	classifying natural textures than others. Finally we apply our new
	approach on landscape scenes: we show how the new language is used
	for defining texture classes.},

We present an uniform and flexible framework for advanced process management on an abstract level which uses and adapts agent technology from distributed artificial intelligence for both modelling and enacting of processes. We identify two different frameworks for applying agent technology to process management: First, as a multi-agent system with the domain of process management. Second, as a key infrastructure technology for building a process management system. We will then follow the latter approach and introduce different agent types for managing activities, products, and resources which capture specific views on the process.},

	The doctors therefore are frequently forced to assess the use of
	a definite therapy with the complex medical condition of a patient.
	The application of risk scores which shall determine a condition
	on the base of many initial parameters establishes herself in this
	framework. Classic representatives, like TISS (Cullen, 1974) or APACHE
	(Knauss, 1981), deal with the forecast of the patients mortality.
	However, this can play only a subordinate roll in the medical weekday
	since a therapy decision may not only depend on the patient's mortality.
	Were examined within the Center for Computing Technology (TZI) therefore,
	how medically relevant symptoms or risks can be predicted instead
	of the mortality. The patient dates of the TISS and APACHE II scores,
	acquired within a year at the clinic for anaesthesia and operative
	intensive medicine, form the base. The automatic generation of risk
	classifications should be based on the examination so that new classifications
	can be found easily. The procedure of the Knowledge Discovery from
	Databases (KDD), also called Data Mining, was used to generate risk
	classifications for the prediction of an infection or a long therapy
	at the intensive care unit. The used methods were based in the statistics,
	machine learning and neuroinformatic. At the examination three general
	problems of the KDD by the generation of risk classifications occured:
	1. The available KDD tools support the process of the generation
	of risk classifications only insufficiently. Defining the problem
	definition, preprocessing of the data and the later application of
	the classification remain particularly open. 2. The in the artificial
	intelligence usual analysis of the misclassification doesn't suffice
	in the medicine. Methods with very good misclassification installments
	have partly not carried out any discrimination of the patients but
	assigned the complete patient collective to one illness group. Here
	a result must be evaluated using sensitivity and specificity. 3.
	Neural networks have a particularly high quality in the prediction,
	but, because using a black-box technique, they are not applicable
	in the medical weekday. A solution of this difficulties can be found
	in new works on the areas of rule extraction from neural networks
	and of decision tree extraction from complex classificators. These
	attempts try to combine the quality advantages of complex classificators
	with the explainability of simple rules or decision trees.},

	(e.g. video audio, image, and also text documents) require efficient,
	effective, and automatic annotation and retrieval methods. As videos
	start to play an even more important role in multimedia, content-based
	retrieval of videos becomes an issue, especially as ther should be
	an intergrated methodology for all types of multimedia documents.
	Our approach for the intergrated retrieval of videos, images, and
	text comprises three necessary steps: First, the detection and extraction
	of shot from a video, second, the construction of a still image from
	the frames in a shot. This is achieved by an extraction of key frames
	or a mosaicing technique. The result is a single image visualization
	of a shot, which in turn can be analyzed by the ImageMiner(TM) system.
	The ImageMiner system was developed in cooperation with IBM at the
	University of Bremen in the Image Processing Department of the Center
	for Computing Technologies. It realizes the content-based retrieval
	of single images through a novel combination of techniques and methods
	from computer vision and artificial intelligence. Its output is a
	textual description of an image, and thus in our case, of the static
	elements of a video shot. In this way, the annotations of a video
	can be indexed with standard text retrieval systems, along with text
	documents or annotations of other multimedia documents, thus ensuring
	an integrated interface for all kinds of multimedia documents.},

	lazy, eager, and selective propagation as well as local customization
	of instances and their upward propagation. Furthermore, we address
	the problem of managing consistent configurations of the versioned
	entities of a workflow schema. In our workflow-specific versioning
	approach, the consistency of the workflow configuration is guaranteed
	and hence the version mechanism is transparent to the user.},

	wurde untersucht, wie mit Hilfe des Knowledge Discovery in Databases
	(KDD) bzw. Data Minings (DM) automatisch Risikoklassifikationen in
	der Dom{\"a}ne Intensivmedizin erstellt werden k{\"o}nnen . Die Risikoklassifikationen
	sollen m{\"o}glichst als eine kompakte Regelmenge dargestellt werden,
	die auch ohne Verwendung eines Computers anwendbar ist. Die Intensivpflege,
	wie sie uns heute bekannt ist, hat sich erst in den sechziger Jahren
	etabliert . Hier werden schwerstkranke Patienten behandelt, so da{\ss}
	der Einsatz modernster Apparate und besonders starker Pharmazeutika
	notwendig ist. In diesem Rahmen sind die Patienten auch mit neuen
	Risiken, wie krankenhausintern erworbenen Infektionen und unerw{\"u}nschten
	Arzneimittelwirkungen konfrontiert. Lebensbedrohliche Lungenentz{\"u}ndungen
	oder Multi-Organversagen sind m{\"o}gliche Folgen. Seit Anfang der
	achtziger Jahre werden sogenannte Risiko-Scores entwickelt, die helfen
	sollen, ausgehend von Risikofaktoren individuelle Risiken f{\"u}r
	den Patienten zu bestimmen. Hierbei wird versucht, das {\"U}berleben,
	die Dauer des Aufenthaltes auf der Intensivstation, Multi-Organversagen

	wie auf der Basis real erhobener Patientendaten automatisch Risikoklassifikationen
	zur Pr{\"a}diktion der Sterbewahrscheinlichkeit, der Entwicklung
	einer Infektion und der Vorhersage der Liegedauer erstellt werden

	Konzepte und Methoden aus den Bereichen Statistik, K{\"u}nstliche

abstract = {Die Bedeutung der Logistik hat in den vergangenen Jahren permanent zuge- nommen. Durch Entwicklungen wie abnehmende Fertigungstiefe, Just-In-Time, Outsourcing und Globalisierung \{\"{a}\}ndert sich die Struktur der Produktion von G\{\"{u}\}tern und Dienstleistungen. Der Umfang der Material- und Informations- fl\{\"{u}\}sse innerhalb der Produktionskette nimmt zu. Dadurch wird der logistische Koordinationsbedarf zwischen den abh\{\"{a}\}ngigen Elementen komplexer, und es entstehen Logistikketten verteilter Produktion. In diesem Zusammenhang sehen sich gerade die Transportdienstleister neuen Anforderungen ausgesetzt, da ihnen verst\{\"{a}\}rkt die Rolle der Organisatoren dieser Logistikkette zukommt. Die aktuellen und k\{\"{u}\}nftig zu erwartenden Rahmenbedingungen im Logistik- bereich bieten ein erhebliches Einsatzpotential f\{\"{u}\}r informationstechnische Unterst\{\"{u}\}tzung. Hier erweisen sich herk\{\"{o}\}mmliche Methoden in zunehmendem Ma\{\ss\}e als unzureichend, da sie die oben 
genannten Entwicklungen nicht ad\{\"{a}\}quat ber\{\"{u}\}cksichtigen. In der Informatik und besonders im Bereich der K\{\"{u}\}nstlichen Intelligenz etabliert sich die Modellierung von komplexen Systemen der realen Welt mit Hilfe von Multi-Agentensystemen. Diese eignen sich besonders zur Anwendung auf Problemstellungen, die Interaktion und im wesentlichen offene, verteilte, heterogene und dynamische Systemaspekte beinhalten. Der Fokus dieser Arbeit liegt auf dem in vieler Hinsicht noch nicht ausgesch\{\"{o}\}pf- ten Anwendungspotential von Multi-Agentensystemen in gro\{\ss\}en Teilen der Logistik. Der technische Teil dieser Arbeit setzt Schwerpunkte auf die Fragen der Modellierung, Realisierung und Angemessenheit des Einsatzes von Multi- Agentensystemen in der Logistik. Die Akzeptanz dieser Technologie h\{\"{a}\}ngt stark davon ab, wie einfach und intuitiv eine Abbildung von der Realit\{\"{a}\}t in ein Multi-Agentensystem erfolgen kann. Dieser Vorgang wird durch geeignete Modellbildung unterst\{\"{u}\}tzt 
und bewirkt eine Reduzierung der Komplexit\{\"{a}\}t des Ausgangssystems. Im Rahmen des Vortrages werden wir die Ans\{\"{a}\}tze und Ergebnisse aus dieser interdisziplin\{\"{a}\}ren Arbeit diskutieren.},

This paradigm also influences engineering processes. Both the characteristics of engineering processes and the interoperability between different organizations challenge the development of enabling technologies to support global engineering networking. Currently available workflow and document/data management technologies fail to support these distributed and collaborative processes. They lack abilities for supporting crossorganizational processes on the level of workflow as well as document management. Furthermore, only little support is provided for collaborative workflows.

@inproceedings{Knirschd,
abstract = {Logistics is gaining increasing economical and theoretical interest. This trend is enforced by a radical change of mainly tayloristically and nationally focussed economy to a worldwide distributed one. In this framework, the relevancy of coordinating information flows and hence well-defined interfaces between participants is growing. Moreover, the range of cooperation between producers lasts from short-term to long-term duration. This yields the existence of temporal logistics networks that can persist for an arbitrary period of time. A modern approach in computer science to model distributed systems is the use of multiagent systems. This paper addresses to the problem of adequacy of their application in the field of temporal logistics networks. Especially dynamical aspects within the structure of logistics networks and environmental change can be modeled naturally. Agents are able to recognize changes and to update their own view of their environment and to recreate software systems partially 
automatically. This is due to their ability to sense their environment, to communicate, and their strict modularity. So this technique does not only support the first design but also its latter management and control. Because of its flexibility concerning the number of participants it enables the transition from alliance-based to open, in particular market-based, systems.},

abstract = {Modern multiagent technology can be applied fruitfully to supply chain or - to be more precise - to demand chain management. In current research there is not much discussed in this direction because today's business processes are often characterized more by small solutions than by integrated ones. This paper will prove that this approach offers very new and challenging possibilities to manage demand chain networks keeping in mind future developments that are hard to predict. We claim that concerning every facet of logistics efficient information flows are essential. A short case study of an industrial setting with new high technology support will outline the concrete business approach and its benefits.},

abstract = {Strategische Unternehmensentscheidungen markieren oft die Grenze zwischen
	makro- und mikro{\"o}konomischen Aspekten insofern als sie einerseits
	eine makro{\"o}konomische {"}Weltsicht{"} und Prospektion der langfristigen
	Entwicklung benutzen und andererseits eine enge Verbin-dung zu den
	mikro{\"o}konomischen Unternehmenszielen im Einzelnen herstellen.
	Ein besonders interessantes Problem stellt dabei die Zeitdimension
	der {\"U}berpr{\"u}fung von Zielsetzungen dar. Das grundlegende Dilemma
	besteht darin, dass eine zu lange verfolgte Strategie ins Leere laufen
	kann, weil sich inzwischen z.B. der makro{\"o}konomische Rahmen ver{\"a}ndert
	hat. Umge-kehrt kann ein zu schnelles Aufgeben der im {"}long run{"}
	erfolgreichen Strategie zum Misser-folg f{\"u}hren. Bei der Entwicklung
	effizienter Systeme kooperativer Agenten tritt diese Problematik
	eben-falls auf. Innerhalb des Projektes {"}IntaPS{"} wird eine Agentenarchitektur
	verwendet, die eine Modellierung der Eigenschaften Pro-Aktivit{\"a}t,
	Reaktivit{\"a}t und Kommunikation durch explizi-tes internes Konfliktmanagement
	und Konfliktresolution zul{\"a}sst (cobac-Ansatz). Dieser An-satz
	stellt eine Erweiterung der BDI Architektur dar, in dem die Schritte
	der Optionsgenerie-rung und Aktionsselektion durch das Konfliktmanagement
	substituiert werden. Die aktuell verfolgte Strategie ist dabei in
	den Bewertungsfunktionen der Ziele im Konfliktmanagement implizit
	enthalten. Das Dilemma findet sich deshalb in der relativen Konstanz
	der Bewer-tungsfunktionen wieder. Das im folgenden skizzierte Verfahren
	der Strategiedetermination bzw. -redetermination ist ein entsprechenden
	spieltheoretischen Ans{\"a}tzen nachempfundener heuristischer Ansatz,
	bei dem die Strategiekonstanz {\"u}ber die Ver{\"a}nderung des Weltmodells
	und die {"}Agentenzufriedenheit{"} gesteuert wird, in der sich eine

	digital image analysis approaches for object recognition and tracking
	in SAR satellite image sequences. The focus was put on the development
	of a new software system for the recognition and tracking of ice
	floes and icebergs. In order to extract the drift information from
	the SAR image sequence various image processing steps have to be
	carried out, i.e. preprocessing, contour analysis and motion tracking.
	The system provides miscellaneous operators for image preprocessing,
	edge detection methods and various approaches to image motion analysis.
	By building up an image processing graph, the different operators
	may be configured and composed together by the user to enhance the
	quality of the single images and to detect objects and analyse object

	of the documents contents. In case of digital video documents the
	annotation contains syntactical information concerning the cut pattern
	and camera movement as well as information concerning the contents
	of the video. The manual annotation effort for an archivist is up
	to eight hours for a one hour video. Using the methods developed
	within the first phase of the AVAnTA project this effort can be reduced
	by one third; Mainly by use of syntactical analysis methods the archivist

abstract = {In recent years the amount of available information in almost any areas of life has risen enormously. Professionals are confronted with a world, in which information sources of any kind are connected and integrated in computer networks. The most famous one - the so-called Internet - enables people all over the world to share information about developments, trends, research etc. in the shape of documents. This great enhancement of intellectual potential and the new chances for distributing and sharing cognitive processes implies on the other hand a increasing need for organization and filtering of information provided by these new sources. Information filtering and information retrieval has been an actual subject of ongoing research in computer science and artificial intelligence for this reason in recent years. The exponential increase of relevant information accessible in the new information environment serves as a booster for this research. Currently one of the most promising research fields in 
computer science in order to support the automation of information filtering and retrieval are multiagent systems , , , , . Intelligent agents rep-resent a modern approach in Artificial Intelligence and distributed software engineering dealing with software entities which can act autonomously, communicate with other agents, are goal-oriented (pro-active) and are using explicit knowledge . They are often used for tasks, which can be hardly solved monolithically and are showing a natural distribution, such as information networks. In these domains agents gain great benefit as they are able to collaborate and solve problems in a distributed manner. Especially in the field of information logistics there is a huge unused potential of this technology . Representing user interest agents are capable of organizing, controlling and managing information ows autonomously. The topic of this report is design of a multiagent architecture for infor-mation retrieval and filtering. Focusing on an enhancement of the existing 
non-distributed information filtering system Sifter two concepts will be presented. The first approach stays on a high level of abstraction using an alternative filtering process. In contrast the lat-ter one is using the Sifter approach as a basis and is worked out in more detail.},

abstract = {In recent years the interest in agent technology and other agent-related topics has risen enormously. This is mainly a result of the spreading of both - global network agents that can act independently, and the expectation that very complex tasks can be solved by agents concurrently. Research groups around the world spend considerable amounts of time and effort to explore and develop new agent technologies which can be applied to numerous problems. Artificial intelligence approaches seem to be appropriate for the development of intelligent agent systems. For long-term success of intelligent agents and multiagent systems it is absolutely crucial to transfer research results into commercial applications. Logistics is a promising field of application because of its inherent complexity. This cannot be overcome by conventional approaches, especially information and product logistics. Two main topics can be identified. First, AI researchers create intelligent agents on a theoretical level in order to 
develop, refine, and evaluate various concepts, methods, and techniques. Second, multiagent systems are used for modeling, managing, controlling, and simulating information flows within single companies or networks of companies, e.g. logistic networks on a more application-oriented level. The application potential of intelligent agents is almost unlimited and often leads to the use of ?intelligent objects? in software engineering tasks. As yet, the engineering aspects of this technology have neither been realized nor satisfyingly considered. Therefore, only a small number of concepts, methodologies, and large-scale scenarios for adequate applications of multiagent systems in the industry are available to-date. The workshop tries to bridge this gap in bringing together theory and practice through a hopefully productive dialogue of researchers from the different disciplines. The following aspects will be discussed: - Theoretical and methodological foundations of multiagent systems - Identification, modeling, 
simulation, and formal representation of real-world business scenarios in logistics concerning either manufacturing or health care - Further improvements of agent technology in the context of well-defined problems of the logistical domain - Business- and market-related impacts of agent technologies - Mutual influences of evolving business standards, e.g., Jini and XML, and their fruitful merging with existing agent technology standards. Eleven papers have been accepted for presentation. The workshop has been subdivided into four sessions dealing with Agent Technologies in Logistics, Transportation Logistics, Negotiation Models, and Application and Perspectives. The workshop has been organized by a joint committee consisting of Nadia Abchiche, Paul Davidsson, Yves Demazeau, Francisco J. Garijo, Otthein Herzog, Stefan Kirn, Peter Knirsch, Heinz-J\{\"{u}\}rgen M\{\"{u}\}ller, Charles Petrie, Mathias Petsch, Catherine Tessier, and Ingo J. Timm.

	liefert. Die Objekterkennung verwendet eine Variante der beschr{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½kten
	Baumsuche2zur Zuordnung der Merkmale aus der Segmentierung zu Objektmerkmalen.
	Im Rahmen vorhergehender Arbeiten3 entstand ein Segmentierungsverfahren,
	das kanten- sowie regionenbasierte Segmentierungsans{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½ze
	kombiniert. Zun{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½hst wird sowohl auf das gegl{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½tete
	Tiefenbild als auch auf das Grauwertbild der Sobeloperator angewendet
	und dessen Ergebnisse binarisiert. Zu diesen beiden Merkmalsquellen
	wird eine weitere hinzugefgt. Das Tiefenbild wird in Bl{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½ke
	aufgeteilt, die mit einer planaren Funktion approximiert werden.
	Wenn der Approximationsfehler einen Schwellwert berschreitet, wird
	der Block als Kantenblock eingestuft. Aus diesen drei Merkmalsquellen
	werden die endgltigen Kantenbereiche ermittelt. Dazu wird ein Punkt
	als endgltiger Kantenpunkt markiert, wenn dieser in mindestens zwei
	der drei Merkmalsquellen als Kantenpunkt detektiert wurde bzw. zu
	einem Kantenblock geh{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½t. Anschlie{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½nd werden die
	Bl{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½ke, die nicht als Kantenbl{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½ke markiert wurden,
	zu Regionen verschmolzen. Diese Regionen werden in einem weiteren
	Schritt pixelweise in die Kantenbereiche ausgedehnt. Das Segmentierungsverfahren
	liefert eine Segmentbeschreibung, die aus der Kontur und einer Fl{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½henfunktion,
	welche die von der Kontur eingeschlossene Fl{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½he mathematisch
	approximiert, besteht. Die Fl{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½henfunktion ist eine Polynomfunktion
	maximal zweiten Grades. Im letzten Schritt erfolgt eine Konturpunktreduktion,
	die die Kontur auf wesentliche Punkte, insbesondere Eckpunkte, beschr{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½kt
	und damit fr die weitere Verarbeitung vorbereitet. Das Verfahren
	liefert eine Beschreibung der erkannten Objekte hinsichtlich ihrer
	Lage im Raum. Dazu wird die Transformation der Modelldaten in Szenendaten
	in Form von Translation und Rotation bestimmt. Diese Ergebnisdaten
	werden in einer VRML-Umgebung dargestellt und sind beispielsweise
	zur Ansteuerung eines Roboters in einer industriellen Umgebung verwendbar.

	often contain important and exclusive information about the video
	contents which cannot be found in the other information channels
	like the audio signal or the underlying video stream. Therefore,
	it is very helpful to extract these textual information automatically
	and add this information to a video index as it is generated by a
	video archiving and retrieval systems like e.g. ADViSOR1, AVAnTA
	or DiVA . Due to the fact that common OCR systems are restricted
	to binary images the video frames have to be preprocessed to extract
	the textual inserts from the image in the background. In this paper
	a new approach for segmentation of textual inserts from digital videos
	or images is proposed. The main difficulties are the low resolution
	and quality of digital video material, the high amount of image data,
	the very complex structured and textured background and the unknown
	color, size and position of the text to extract from the image. 1

	a system both to support and simplify the performed tasks during
	the archive and to improve the efficiency of the retrieval process
	as well. The presented system comprises two modules: a) the Video
	Indexing Studio (VIS) containing the multimedia indexing methods
	and tools, which are developed and enhanced in order to perform the
	archive tasks automatically, and b) the Video Exploitation System
	(VES), which operates as the retrieval interface. The VIS allows
	the segmentation of a video into single shots, the extraction of
	representative frames and the processing of the textual inserts into
	a suitable form as an input to a standard optical character recognition
	system. The shot clustering method, which is also included into VIS,
	provides the basic scene (sequence of shots with linked up contents)
	detection functionality by permitting a semantic interpretation of
	the scene, e.g. certain sequences can lead to the conclusion that
	this specific scene is a dialogue. Furthermore an additional valuable
	component for the semantic interpretation of scenes or shots is motion
	tracking, where moving objects are detected and their motion is described.

	a certain scale. This scale is either explicitly defined in the image,
	like scales of a previously identified axis or is intrinsic to the
	type of the chart (e.g. angles in pie charts). After the primal classification
	the extracted tabular data is collected and analyzed systematically
	to produce a representation that subdivides a chart into predefined
	levels. These levels are presented through verbal descriptions. A

abstract = {Nowadays, one of the greatest challenges companies have to face is the change towards flexible and demand-driven production. More information has to be handled and a considerable speed-up of development and manufacturing processes is needed. However, the actual situation is characterized by strong borderlines between process planning, production control and scheduling systems, caused by extreme specialisation and independent historical paths of system evolution. This gap implies loss of time and of information. Thus, there is a strong need for innovative concepts for management and control of integrated information logistics, production scheduling and process planning. Agent-based information technologies like the innovative concept of co-operative agent systems are promising approaches for more flexible and distributed production networks. Agents are autonomously, co-operatively and goal-oriented acting intelligent software units. The use of agents for managing information within production 
control and process planning makes short term and flexible reaction to unexpected events and disturbances in manufacturing (e.g. break down of machines or lack of other resources as well as unexpected change of market situation) possible. Thus, enterprises will react to changing requirements in a more flexible way and will be able to face the challenges of international competition successfully.},

  abstract = {The problem of finding the intended image (or photography) is well
	known. Especially in the context of so-called image retrieval systems.
	Content is necessary to retrieve the intended image out of a large
	database. In order to automatically extract content from an image,
	certain features - color, texture, or contour - are needed. Texture
	is one important feature in the context of content-based image retrieval
	systems like IRIS. Particularly within the scope of a query, texture
	is a powerful criterion for searching. Therefore, a domain-independent
	texture analysis, i.e. a segmentation and classification approach
	is needed. The texture segmentation is implemented by a combination
	of region- and edge-oriented segmentation methods. The texture region
	image and the texture edges image are combined to one texture-based
	segmented image. The classification part provides an approach for
	automatic texture description based on visual texture properties.
	A set of texture features, which directly coincide with the human
	visual perception of textures, is used for a domain-independent texture
	classification. This could be used in image retrieval systems. The
	methods using visual properties were tested on natural textures as
	well as on synthetic textures. Various statistical texture features
	were evaluated and we found a direct mapping between certain statistical
	texture features and the items of the set of visual texture properties.},

	the DSD we use a domain independent incremental structure-based configuration
	approach with different knowledge representation mechanisms and a
	sophisticated declarative control. Currently DSD is used with great
	success by approx. 150 sales engineers of the company Lenze for the

However, participating enterprises have to meet several requirements such as providing a specified product at a defined time to the customer reliably. Customers will switch to other contractors for their orders in future if their requirements are not met. Thus, unfulfilled requirements will weaken the market position with a lasting influence for the respective enterprise. This situation is enforced by highly customised products even in serial production, dynamic behaviour of the supply chain itself as well as by high complexity of design and manufacturing processes. Consequently, innovative concepts for improved information logistics are necessary for competitive manufacturing. The idea of using multiagent systems for this purpose is very promising. This paper presents an approach for 
integrated agent-based process planning and production control and focuses on agents in the manufacturing domain as well as agent-based production control.},

  abstract = {Efficient information management and the processes therein become
	more and more important within enterprises or when enterprises are
	merging together. Most information systems use specific data models
	and databases for this purpose. This implies that making new data
	available to the system requires, that the data be transferred, into
	the system's specific data format. This is a process, which is very
	time consuming and tedious. Data acquisition, automatically or semi-automatically,
	often makes large-scale investment in technical infrastructure and/or
	manpower inevitable. These obstacles are some of the reasons behind
	the concept of information integration. Problems that might arise
	due to heterogeneity of the data are already well known within the
	distributed database systems community (e.g. ). In general, heterogeneity
	problems can be divided into three categories: Syntax (e. g. data
	format heterogeneity) Structure (e. g. homonyms, synonyms or different
	attributes in database tables) Semantic (e. g. intended meaning of
	terms in a special context or application) For information management
	problems on the structural and semantic level with regards to terminologies
	are important. Terminologies are important because they contain the
	companies' knowledge. The IT manager is confronted with the task
	of how to map one terminology to another terminology. Lately, approaches
	based on formal ontologies have shown that they are promising. We
	discuss an ontology-based approach for the solution to this problem.
	This approach has been developed within the BUSTER (Bremen University
	Semantic Translator for Enhanced Retrieval) project which addresses
	the above mentioned categories by providing a common interface to
	heterogeneous information sources in terms of an intelligent information
	broker (see www.semantic-translation.com).},

	Nowadays, this is changing as ongoing standardisation efforts within

	and the W3C are providing standard interaction mechanisms for agent
	based software and Web technologies. FIPA?s aim is to promote technologies

  abstract = {In developing agents and multi-agent systems, computer scientists
	typically bring their work to bear on theories and methods from social
	sciences. Examples include computational and agent-based approaches
	to the study of negotiation, social interaction, contracts, agreement,
	organization, cohesion, social order, and collaboration. Moreover,
	agent technology and especially multi-agent systems have led to a
	fundamental new impulse of computer simulation to support social
	science. In the same light Socionics has established as the new interdisciplinary
	area between Sociology and ?Informatics?. The MASHO workshop aims
	at exchanging and integrating ideas from different aspects of agent-oriented
	approaches in connection with organizational knowledge, structures
	and behaviour. Special topics of interest are: modelling of artificial
	and hybrid organizations; agent behaviour in organizational structures;
	commitment, delegation, responsibility and obligations in artificial
	and hybrid societies; semantics of the dynamics of organizational
	models; organizational roles and structures; adaptive learning and
	models of organizational cognition; simulation of artificial and
	hybrid societies. Because of the interdisciplinary character of the
	covered content scientists from different fields are encouraged to
	participate. The accepted contributions to this year?s MASHO can
	be divided into three categories: the use of social concepts to improve
	the design of individual agents, the use of social concepts in the
	aim for scalable multi-agent systems, and the use of negotiation
	to solve the shift-exchange problem of hospital staff. These categories
	show the three important aspects of multi-agent technology: design
	of agents, design of multi-agent systems and the application of multi-agent
	technology to solve problems in society. Moreover, these categories
	also show the important cross-contribution of sociology and multi-agent
	technology, and thus are in the core of socionics. USING SOCIAL CONCEPTS
	IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AGENT In his contribution Bach argues that
	the application of {"}artificial emotions{"} can be used as a heuristic
	method to reduce the complexity of search algorithms. He motivates
	this by considering the problem of perception and planning in software
	agents in complex environments. Bach proposes two approaches to keep
	the complexity of their percepts and the respective ontologies in
	check: using ?emotional states? to reduce the complexity of searches,
	and using acquired hierarchical categories to efficiently represent
	complex plans and actions. For the idea of emotional states the author
	proposes the use of an agent structure that is loosely based on the
	?Psi?-theory of emotion by D{\"o}rner. The structure is enhanced
	by hierarchical categories. The information processing of the Psi
	agents is based on the idea that the elements of perception and imagination
	are fundamentally the same. Thus, perceptions are imaginations, which
	are inspired by and verified against external sensory data. Tomic-Koludrovic,
	Mitrovic, and Petric contribute to the development of artificial
	agents that are not only individually but also socially believable.
	They identify specific elements and concepts from sociologic models
	of habitus, lifestyle and subcultural style. These concepts are argued
	to be relevant for the development of computational models of socially
	believable agents. The authors hope that by providing artificial
	{"}embodied{"} agents with attributes reflecting e.g. their visual
	and linguistic style, an important gain in the social believability
	of these characters can be accomplished. This can be regarded as
	a first step towards a formal model and a proof of concept implementation,
	which would be interesting to see in a contribution to the next MASHO
	workshop. USING NEGOTIATION TO REARRANGE HOSPITAL SHIFTS M{\"u}ller,
	Hahne, Monett, and Lindemann study the use of negotiations in the
	sociological context of exchanging shifts between hospital staff.
	In their contribution they propose to use the fundaments of formal
	role theory and Bourdieu?s capital sort theory as the basis for the
	negotiation process. Social role behaviour is obtained by the definition
	of social types depending on the internal distribution of the different
	capital sorts. Individual preferences are reflected in the internal
	micro-structure by a weighted distribution of capital sorts and a
	dedicated interest function. Lettkemann, Meister, Hanft, Schr{\"o}ter,
	and Malitz are also interested in the use of negotiation to solve
	the shift-exchange problem of hospital staff. In contrast to the
	work of M{\"u}ller et al., in their contribution Lettkemann and colleagues
	propose the use of {"}group figures{"} as introduced by Popitz to
	this practical problem. The authors carefully explain the required
	group figures with respect to the hospital domain and the evaluation
	of shifts necessary for the negotiation process. A comparison of
	the results of both approaches in order to evaluate their respective
	strengths and weaknesses would be interesting. Hopefully, next MASHO
	will see such a comparison. SCALABILITY OF MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS The
	contribution of Schillo, Fley, Florian, Hillebrandt, and Hinck proposes
	the use of the sociological concept of delegation to the study of
	scalability and (self-) organization in multiagent systems. Their
	ideas are based on the habitus-field theory of Bourdieu in which
	organizations are viewed as ?social fields? operating ?corporate
	agents? that are competing with other organizations in the same domain.
	They argue that the concepts of scalability and (self-) organization
	typically used in DAI are missing the special quality of organizations
	in comparison with pure social interactions between individual agents.
	Then, they introduce FORM, the Framework for Self-Organization and
	Robustness in Multi-agent systems. FORM shows sociological characteristics
	of organizations in the form of delegation, which is used as the
	central concept to define organizational forms and relationships
	in task assignment. In their contribution K{\"o}hler and R{\"o}lke
	propose the use of a very general type of general Petri nets (R.
	Valk's Nets with nets as tokens) to serve as a modelling aid for
	social systems - from the micro up to the macro level. Their research
	is motivated by the research question of the micro-macro link. The
	question of the micro-macro link addresses the emergent aggregation
	of micro-processes (like group interactions) into macro ones (like
	the establishment of dominance). They argue that addressing the micro-macro
	link issue is vital for the design of scalable multiagent systems.
	The authors both modified and augmented Valk?s Nets and propose to
	use the resulting nets as tools to model social systems. In this
	manner they hope to simultaneously describe the micro and the macro
	level in one model. To this purpose they referred to elements of
	extant micro-macro models from sociological theory. SPECIAL TRACK:
	RESOLVING CONFLICTS IN SELF-INTERESTED AGENTS Existing development
	and design of multiagent systems has largely focused on global optimization
	issues and on providing an infrastructure enabling agents to technically
	interact with and collaborate. As software agents are increasingly
	assisting human users in both closed and open environments, their
	goals, strategies and preferences will reflect the self-interest
	of their human or institutional owners. This is of increasing concern
	for future applications like electronic commerce, peer-to-peer computing,
	or mobile computing, where software agents have a huge potential
	to act as intelligent assistants. Conflicts about e.g. the access
	to goods, services, schedules and other resource assignments will
	occur inevitably and often. Fraudulent agents may even submit unjustified
	resource claims. However, a centralized, acknowledged coordinator
	institution couldn?t be assumed to exist. Thus, self-interested software
	agents will have to detect and resolve conflicts either individually,
	in a cooperative group, or by delegation to specialized instances.
	They need assessment and management tools to detect and resolve conflicts.
	Similar to human conflict resolution, they may use negotiation, mediation,
	arbitration or legislative approaches. SPECIAL TRACK: FOUNDATIONS
	OF MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS THE ECONOMIC THEORY PERSPECTIVE Since the early
	work of Rosenschein in 1984/1985, many researchers in Distributed
	AI have demonstrated that theoretical concepts from microeconomic
	theory and management science provide valuable contributions to the
	design and control of software agents. Until now, utility theories
	(using preferences, motivations, desires, and intentions), theories
	of organizational design, planning and negotiation mechanisms, competition
	vs. cooperation, game theory, and decision theory have been investigated

  title = {Proceedings of Workshop 20: Agent Technology in Logistics},
  year = {2002},
  month = {July},
  abstract = {Since the early 90ies, co-operative multiagent systems and intelligent
	agents are of increasing concern within software engineering of large
	scale distributed systems. In the last years multiagent systems have
	become a leading edge technology. Agent technology seems to be a
	promising approach if applied to computer-mediated supply webs. Supporting
	the management and integration of planning, scheduling, and controlling
	processes they can be used as {"}enterprise delegates{"}. However,
	on the one hand this leads to a problem with common agent architectures,
	as they are not designed to model the complex decision behavior of
	entire companies. Furthermore enterprises have to deal with various
	targets, which leads to mutual conflicts of interest. On the other
	hand computermediated supply webs have to handle critical paths,
	bottlenecks and risk of failures along actual paths (e.g. accidents)
	to meet strict just-in-time requirements in real-time. New challenges
	in logistics can be found in the information exchange between cooperating
	enterprises. Classical approaches tried to integrate systems and
	standardize information exchange between enterprises. Conversion
	of existing systems to standardized and integrated systems requires
	significants efforts with respect to both cost and time consumption.
	New approaches should enable the interaction of distributed systems
	and the information exchange on the basis of explicit semantical
	descriptions (integration and standardization versus distribution
	and communication). Taking this into account agent technologies seem
	to be the method of choice. For the long-term success of intelligent
	agents and multiagent systems it is absolutely necessary to transfer
	research results into commercial applications. Two main topics can
	be identified. Firstly, AI researchers create intelligent agents
	to develop, refine and evaluate various concepts, methods, and techniques.
	Secondly, multiagent systems are used for modeling, managing, controlling
	and simulating information flows within single companies or networks
	of companies, e.g., logistic networks. These two different efforts
	are about to result in a potential separation of theory and practice.
	The workshop tries to bridge this gap in bringing together theory
	and practice through a hopefully productive dialogue of researchers
	from the different disciplines. The following aspects will be discussed:
	Theoretical and methodological foundations of multiagent systems
	Identification, modeling, simulation, and formal representation of
	real-world business scenarios in logistics Further improvements of
	agent technology in the context of well-defined problems of the logistical
	domain Ontologies and modern approaches of intelligent information
	interchange Eight papers have been accepted for presentation. The
	morning will deal with formal and theoretical perspectives on agent
	technologies in logistics. After lunch the talks will discuss agents
	in transportation logistics as well as supply chain monitoring.},

Nevertheless, these approaches do not solve the issue of semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we present a use case from the area of disaster management, which illustrates the benefits of employing a state-of-the-art SDI. The use case also points out several semantic heterogeneity problems that need to be solved. We analyse these problems and present approaches to their solution, which are currently developed in the research project Semantic Interoperability by means of Geoservices (meanInGs).},

	used to optimize segmentation stability upon object shape change
	and background variation, thereby increasing path precision. Overlapping
	paths and cell-cell contacts were resolved by a subtraction algorithm

Especially in production engineering with its increasing concern of knowledge about sophisticated manufacturing processes, relying on simple concept equality is not suitable to fulfill demands of current industrial applications. Thus, enhanced methods like ontology-based capability management presented in this paper have to be established to address this problem. For the case of indifferent concepts we are introducing a conflict-
based approach for capability negotiation as well as an application scenario for this approach in the manufacturing domain.},

  abstract = {There exists a strong need for a qualitative spatial knowledge representation
	that is capable of modeling and of reasoning about knowledge of genomic
	structures. The reasoning component can help to improve the biological
	plausibility of existing alignment approaches for bacterial genomic
	DNA sequences, which at present relies exclusively on similarity
	comparisons on the string level. Genomic DNA sequences of bacteria,
	even within the same species, can be highly variable. This variability
	exists not only at the string level, but also at the structural level,
	i.e. the order of genes and their coding is less conserved as could
	be expected. Therefore, the comparisons of genomic DNA sequences
	should not only use the sequence similarity on the string level,
	but they should rather be extended to the structural level. We present
	a concept to support the alignment procedure with one-dimensional
	spatial knowledge of genomic structures like genes and their regulatory
	regions, which is expressive since it allows a specification and
	reasoning about spatial relations between genomic structures by dis-junctions
	of qualitative relations.},

In some cases it is impossible to acquire all situations an agent might have to deal with later at run-time in advance. Here, an automated acquisition of patterns would help an agent to adapt to the environment. Agents in dynamic environments have to deal with world representations that change over time. Additionally, predicates between arbitrary objects can exist in their belief of the world. In this work we present a learning approach that learns temporal patterns from a sequence of predicates.},

Gerade in heterogenem Umfeld, in denen ein Agent nicht nur Teil eines Systems ist, sondern sich zum Beispiel im Internet dynamisch neuen Systemen anschlie\ss t, bildet die Kommunikation ein wichtiges Medium zur Organisation von Agentengesellschaften. Besonders popul\"{a}r sind elektronische Marktpl\"{a}tze, die eine effiziente Koordination mit einfachen Algorithmen zur Verf\"{u}gung stellen. Die Kommunikationsregeln k\"{o}nnen dabei lokalen Besonderheiten unterliegen. Daher sollte ein Agent sein Kommunikationsverhalten lokalen Besonderheiten anpassen. In diesem Beitrag wird der Diskurs-Agent (oac-Ansatz) eingef\"{u}hrt, der eine solche offene und adaptive Kommunikation erm\"{o}glicht. Es wird ein Szenario entwickelt, in dem der 
Diskursagent in seinem Selbstlernprozess \"{u}berpr\"{u}ft wird. Im Ergebnis zeigt der Agent ein sehr effektives und gegen\"{u}ber einem nicht lernenden Agenten hoch signifikant besseres Resultat. Die Reproduzierbarkeit der Ergebnisse wurde mit unabh\"{a}ngigen Wiederholungen best\"{a}tigt.

For this reason the logistic processes have to be planned in consideration of special transportation conditions. In this context, the existence of possible hazards and chances has to be regarded. In order to handle the existing risks of logistic systems and especially for sensitive goods we propose a proactive risk management (RM) system to supplement a holistic process management. It supports the design of processes which are robust and insusceptible to existing and occurring anthropogenic and environmental hazards. This paper analyzes essential parts for a convenient risk definition and examines concepts and tools that allow the adequate management of system and process related risk.},

  school = {Universit{\"a}t Bremen},

  address = {Bremen, Germany},
  abstract = {Graphical queries for the purpose of searching for pictorial information
	are of growing interest in areas where pictures provide valuable
	information, including, for instance, design, architecture, and engineering.
	Sketching graphical queries is a natural way of revealing the visual
	appearance of objects one has in mind. The problem which arises is
	identifying necessary shape properties of sketches, that is, those
	properties which are not accidental but are necessary for specifying
	a particular object property. This problem arises in particular because
	sketches are imprecise, and often distorted by the artistic limitations
	of the sketcher. From the theoretical point of view the concept of
	\textbackslashtextit{pictorial space} applies. In this context, new
	concepts are required, in particular for dealing with imprecise shape
	information in the plane. Taking into account constraints imposed
	by pictorial space, a relation algebra of intersection-free relations
	is proposed, which allows reasoning about qualitative line arrangements
	in the plane. The theory is further developed for characterising
	polygons, by deriving a number of qualitative properties which aid
	in describing polygons qualitatively. Applying this theory, only
	line arrangements which are both readily sketched and easily perceivable
	are considered to be different. The notion of positional-contrast
	is introduced, which points out that the particular arrangements
	of line segments, i.e. their positions relative to each other, provide
	an expressive means of characterising necessary shape properties.
	The method developed in this work is applied in using graphical queries
	to search for historical objects. Specifying objects graphically,
	it is shown that the new method is capable of dealing with imprecise
	sketches by describing necessary shape properties using qualitative
	line arrangements, i.e. by taking into account positional-contrast.
	Overall, the investigations which are carried out in this work pertain
	to the field of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.
	The representation developed here sticks to ideas developed in the
	field of \textbackslashtextit{qualitative spatial reasoning} ---
	one of its principal goals being the representation of commonsense
	knowledge about the physical world. As is common practice in this
	field, knowledge about the domain in hand is made explicit in order
	to arrive at efficient reasoning methods. Here, we confine ourselves
	to a representation of shape information and make explicit knowledge
	about our object of research, namely about imprecise shape information
	in picture space.},

  howpublished = {General Assembly of the European Geosciences Union (EUG) Vienna},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {Currently, the multitude of information about marine geophysical,
	biological data and spatial patterns increases tremendously. Compared
	to the increasing amount of information only a few concepts and techniques
	are applied for efficient visualisation and optimal analysis of present
	and upcoming data sets. There is a considerable need for a generalised
	analysis of acoustic data, still photographs, video flows and video
	mosaics of the sea floor. For example, more than 4200 geo-referenced
	video mosaics have been derived during the RV Polarstern equipped
	with the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Victor6000 cruise to the
	H{\"\i}{\?}ï¿½on Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) in 2003. Therefore the automatic
	or semiautomatic image analysis gains more and more in importance
	concerning greyscale, colour, texture and contour detection. An automatic
	extraction of the areas of interest could be realized by edge detection
	and geometrical shape recognition of the Freeman Chaincode algorithm.
	The transmission of the shapes into polygons allows a further spatial
	analysis within GIS and with geostatistical methods. This includes
	spatial budgets of geological and biogeochemical cycles and characterisation
	of habitats at the seafloor based on the combination of several information
	layers. The geo-statistical methodology is used to be practiced to
	analyse structures and to describe spatial patterns. The classical
	tool, the interpolation, takes place in describing the variography
	of spatial dependence of data (semi-variance) as a function of their
	distance. This spatial variability is examined in order to derive
	a model which describes the spatial characteristics of the variables.
	This model is the crucial input for the actual interpolation, the
	Kriging. The Indicator Kriging used in this study operates with data
	from a bivariate data type to predict the probability of thresholds
	(e.g. occurrence yes (1) or no (0)) of the same data type at unsampled
	locations. Thus the kriged surfaces reveal whether the probability
	of occurrence of a certain habitat indicator e.g. bacteria mats \textless
	50{\%} is particularly high or particularly low. This can be accomplished
	successively for all interesting regions. Finally a potential habitat
	map of the benthic communities at HMMV results from the interpolation.
	Some surfaces can remain undefined, since the Kriging permits an
	interpolation only up to the distance determined by the semivariogram.
	Beyond that no statements about surfaces are made. For validation
	of the computed results, Kriging allows calculation of standard errors
	of prediction. Furthermore, we applied a cross-validation analysis
	which gives information about the accuracy of the computed maps.
	The combination of semiautomatic video mosaic analysis and geo-statistical
	methods enables us to estimate the percentage of coverage by diverse
	parameters. The different information layers were overlaid by GIS
	technique for the consideration of different geochemical habitats,
	mud flows and calculation of spatial budgets.},

Having an advanced vision system with gaze control in mind a knowledge-based risk assessment can determine where to concentrate the attention. The approach is evaluated by simulating different traffic scenes.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to enable decision-making in a highly distributed multiagent environment where individual agents need to act in an autonomous fashion. Our architecture framework integrates risk management, knowledge management, and agent deliberation to enable sophisticated, autonomous decision-making. Instead of a centralized knowledge repository, our approach supports a highly distributed knowledge base in which each agent manages a fraction of the knowledge needed by the entire system. Our approach also addresses the fact that the desired knowledge is often highly dynamic, context-sensitive, incomplete, or uncertain. Thus risk management becomes an integral component which enables context-based, situation-aware decision making, which in turn supports autonomous, self-managing behavior of the agents. A prototype system demonstrating the feasibility of our approach is being developed as part of an ongoing funded research project.},

	These so called content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems focus

	logics (DL) offer a useful contribution to content-based image retrieval
	while allowing logical reasoning about the semantic contents of the

	a main advantage about traditional classification algorithms. Another
	advantage is the possibility to use domain knowledge, which is formulated
	in DL, on the retrieval side, thus offering a semantic retrieval.

	a DL for classifying image regions.},

Two simulation systems for the analysis of autonomy in logistics an agent-based and a discrete event approach are presented.

We use the Geography Markup Language (GML) to describe geographic data and to conserve the semantic knowledge about geographic features. The description can serve as an input to innovative presentations of spatial structures using haptic and auditory interfaces. To be able to present existing geographic information in a multimodal manner, the data in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and bitmap images has to be transformed to GML. For data stored in GIS, this can easily be performed. For geographic information encoded in bitmap images, we extract geographic features from these images automatically based on color information and model them in GML. Finally an annotation tool enables the publisher to add individual information to maps on the basis of GML. We show exemplarily how our process can be applied to provide access to city maps for blind and visually impaired people.}

Therefore, enterprises will be able to fulfil the requirement of flexible, reliable and fault-tolerant manufacturing. Fulfilment of these requirements is a prerequisite for successful participation in modern business alliances like supply chains, temporal logistics networks and virtual enterprises. Thus, agent-based improvements of information logistics enable enterprises to face the challenges of competition successfully. Conducted research activities focused on the development of agent-based systems for integrated process planning and production control.},

abstract = {Investigating autonomous cooperation in logistic processes is a challenging research topic. In this context, the starting point lies in real world logistic processes which are hitherto centrally organised. Thereby, the practical examination forms the foundation for subsequent investigations from a more theoretical point of view. Owing to Tchibo's agreement to participate in this investigation, their forward logistics processes are the chosen subject of this case study. The following reasons motivate why Tchibo is a good choice as a partner in this research proposal: First, a high percentage of Tchibo's suppliers is located in Far East. As a consequence, Tchibo's logistics department has to deal with complex international processes. Second, Tchibo supplies a great many outlets throughout Europe with a continuously changing range of products. This fact underlines the amount of goods that have to be procured and distributed, but also gives an impression of the dynamics in their processes. The case 
study is conducted on the basis of an internship at Tchibo's forward logistics department as well as divers interviews with their employees.},

abstract = {In the GIS domain we are often faced with a great amount of shape-related data. Therefore, it is a challenging task to find concise description approaches which support the efficient retrieval of specific objects. In order to address this demand we apply a method that has recently been introduced in the context of shape-based image retrieval of two-dimensional silhouettes, namely the scope histogram. Scope histograms pertain to the group of qualitative shape descriptions as they characterise a shape by the general configuration of its parts. In particular, scope histograms allow the comparison of two shapes with constant time complexity. Despite of its low complexity, the approach achieves promising retrieval results. However, up to now the definition of scope histograms is limited to closed polygons. In this paper we investigate the application of scope histograms to the GIS domain. Since the contour of silhouettes is always closed, a restriction to closed polygons is no limitation in that 
domain. By contrast, it frequently is when dealing with GIS data. In this domain, we are rather often faced with open polygons; think for example of courses of rivers, borders, and coastlines. Therefore, we modify the original definition of scope histograms in order to be able to handle arbitrary polygons. Although our new definition leads to a more compact description than the original one, retrieval results are even improved by this modification.},

In order to achieve this, we extend the qualitative concept of positional-contrast by 86 new relations describing the position of polygons w.r.t. their line segments. On this basis a histogram of the relations' frequencies is computed for each shape. A useful property of our approach is that due to the underlying concept of positional-contrast it can be intuitively decided, whether its combination with other features is promising. Especially, retrieval results of about 64\% are achieved in the MPEG test with constant time complexity.},

	imprecise and incomplete sketched shapes. He exemplarily applies
	his method using graphical queries to search for historical objects.
	Specifying objects graphically, he shows that the new method is in
	fact capable of dealing with imprecise sketches. Generally speaking,
	the notion of positional-contrast is introduced. It defines how patterns
	can be robustly dealt with. That is, the new representation distinguishes
	patterns by how they relate with regard to spatial relations. This
	notion can be applied for several purposes, including pattern recognition,

Standard scenarios of logistic processes typically have been modeled on the basis of static graph-theoretic representations. The well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP), the vehicle routing problem (VRP), or the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) reduce the complex task of transportation to a route optimization problem.

  abstract = {The interpretation of scenes, e.g., in videos, is demanding at all
	levels. At the image processing level it is necessary to apply an
	?intelligent? segmentation and to determine the objects of interest.
	For the higher symbolic levels it is a challenging task to perform
	the transition between quantitative and qualitative data and to determine
	the relations between objects. Here we assume that the position of
	objects (?agents?) in images and videos will already be determined
	as a minimal requirement for the further analysis. The interpretation
	of complex and dynamic scenes with embedded intentional agents is
	one of the most challenging tasks in current AI and imposes highly
	heterogeneous requirements. A key problem is the efficient and robust
	representation of uncertainty. We propose that uncertainty should
	be distinguished with respect to two different epistemological sources:
	(1) noisy sensor information and (2) ignorance. In this presentation
	we propose possible solutions to this class of problems. The use
	and evaluation of sensory information in the field of robotics shows
	impressive results especially in the fields of localization (e.g.
	MCL) and map building (e.g. SLAM) but also imposes serious problems
	on the successive higher levels of processing due to the probabilistic
	nature. In this presentation we propose that the use of (a) qualitative
	abstraction (classic approach) from quantitative to (at least partial)
	qualitative representations and (b) coherence-based perception validation
	based on Dempster-Shafer (DST) can help to reduce the problem significantly.
	The second important probability problem class that will be addressed
	is ignorance. In our presentation we will focus on reducing missing
	information by inference. We contrast/compare our experiences in
	an important field of scene interpretation namely plan and intention
	recognition. The first approach is based on a logical abductive approach
	and the second approach in contrast uses a probabilistic approach
	(Relational Hidden Markov Model (RHMM)).},

abstract = {The concept of multiagent-based simulation introduces the agent programming paradigm to simulation. Multiagent systems ease the implementation of software systems to control complex business processes, such as supply chain management (SCM). Problem complexity is decreased by abolishing monolithic programs. Instead, decision-making is delegated to software agents as local entities. This allows coping even with processes that cannot be controlled centrally due to their inherent physical distribution. Simulation allows evaluating logistics strategies regarding their applicability in such processes. However, general agent development frameworks are not designed to consider simulation-specific issues. In particular, they provide no means for synchronisation. This paper identifies time model adequacy, causality, and reproducibility as quality criteria that must be ensured by a simulation middleware implementing synchronisation. Furthermore, a formal definition of these quality criteria for conservative 
synchronisation is presented.},

  abstract = {In a variety of dynamical systems, formations of motion patterns occur.
	Observing colonies of animals, for instance, for the scientist it
	is not only of interest which kinds of formations these animals show,
	but also how they altogether move around. In order to analyse motion
	patterns for the purpose of making predictions, to describe the behaviour
	of systems, or to index databases of moving objects, methods are
	required for dealing with them. This becomes increasingly important
	since a number of technologies have been devised which allow objects
	precisely to get traced. However, the indeterminacy of spatial information
	in real world environments also requires techniques to approximate
	reasoning, for example, in order to compensate for small and unimportant
	distinctions which are due to noisy measurements. As a consequence,
	precise as well as coarse motion patterns have to be dealt with.
	
	A set of sixteen atomic motion patterns is proposed. On the one hand,
	a relation algebra is defined on them. On the other hand, these sixteen
	relations form the basis of a visual language using which motion
	patterns can easily be dealt with in a diagrammatic way. The relations
	are coarse but crisp and they allow imprecise knowledge about motion
	patterns to be dealt with, while their diagrammatic realisation also
	allow precise patterns to get handled. While almost all approaches
	consider motion patterns along arbitrary time intervals, this paper
	in particular focuses on short-term motion patterns as we permanently
	observe them in our everyday life.
	
	The bottom line of the current work, however, is yet more general.
	While it has been widely argued that it makes sense to use both sentential
	and diagrammatic representations in order to represent different
	things in the same system adequately (and hence differently), we
	argue that it makes even sense to represent the same things differently
	in order to grasp different aspects of one and the same object of
	interest from different viewpoints. We demonstrate this by providing
	both a sentential and a diagrammatic representation for the purpose
	of grasping different aspects of motion patterns. It shows that both
	representations complement each other.},

	in a number of fields, such as in qualitative reasoning, and especially
	in spatial planning and vision. Current approaches are confined to
	describing local features while walking along the shapes? boundaries.
	Shapes exist, however, which cannot be distinguished by these methods

	introduce the notion of a global feature scheme in order to compensate
	for the shortcomings of present techniques. This approach is then
	applied to a class of shapes which have previously been shown to
	be difficult to distinguish, and proves capable of telling them apart.
	The method is based on a representation of intersection-free relations
	which complements existing qualitative representations for which
	intersections are virtually fundamental. The conception of global
	feature schemes for shapes generalises to other relational systems
	for which global features are also of importance. That is, the result
	will be that every system of relations which distinguishes at least
	two modes of disconnection constitutes a global feature scheme.},

	A main reason for this is semantic heterogeneity, which occurs at

	level. It is the goal of the work presented in this paper to overcome
	the problems caused by semantic heterogeneity on all three levels.
	We present a method based on ontologies and logical reasoning, which
	enhances the discovery, retrieval, interpretation and integration
	of geographic data in SDIs. Its benefits and practical use are illustrated
	with examples from the domains of geology and hydrology.},

abstract = {Multiagent systems ease the implementation of software systems to control complex processes. Instead of monolithic programs, decision-making is delegated to software agents as local entities. Like in software development in general, testing and evaluation play an important role also for multiagent systems. This is particularly the case because run-time interactions between agents and their effects cannot always be predicted at design time. Multiagent-based simulation is an adequate means to evaluate agents regarding their applicability in real-world operation. However, general agent development frameworks do not consider simulation-specific issues. Because they provide no means for synchronisation, an additional simulation middleware is required. Temporal and implementation-related criteria that are relevant for middleware design are defined in this paper. Furthermore, the actual implementation as well as example applications in logistics are presented.},

@inproceedings{Schuldtd,
abstract = {Spatiotemporal observations are fundamental in the context of analysing behaviours monitored in empirical sciences. A specific subfield is spatiotemporal cooperation that models spatiotemporal relations among agents in order to describe how they collaborate in space and over time: one example is the field of traffic supervision where a number of moving objects is observed; this has, for instance, relevance for autonomous transport and intralogistics. A prominent example are autonomous vehicles that collaboratively unload container vessels at container terminals or that handle material flows in shop floors.

There are two basic scenarios: one might either take up the role of an observer who analyses a group of agents, or one might be herself member of such a group. In both cases an adequate representation is required that models the spatiotemporal behaviours among agents.

This poster shows a number of jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint spatiotemporal motion relations. These relations are easily comprehensible for both an observer of a scene of agents moving around and an agent being herself part of such a scene: only the two sides of a reference object as well as the front, middle, and back of this reference object are distinguished. These simple distinctions make those relations easily perceivable for cognitive agents.

Here, we apply these relations without committing ourselves to any environmental confines. It shows that these relations aid in making incomplete knowledge complete, dealing with coarse and imprecise knowledge, and describing spatiotemporal cooperation without the employment of artificial, external scales: a group of agents itself defines the reference for the spatiotemporal behaviour descriptions of its members.},

	The main advantage of the proposed model is that its nodes can be

	views or part can thus take on the shape of a simple bag of features
	or a geometrically selective constellation model including all forms

@inproceedings{Pantke2009,
abstract = {In Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) for autonomous control of industrial and logistic processes, intelligent agents are often faced with multi-criteria decision problems. The agents' local goal systems may comprise qualitative and quantitative objectives that can conflict at the individual agent's local level as well as on a global scope between agents. In general, the problem to be solved by the MAS cannot be decomposed in a way that eliminates all these conflicts as the competing goals are an integral property of the problem itself. Consequently, acceptable trade-offs need to be identified and negotiated by the agents. Due to the emergent, not entirely predicable behavior of many complex MASs, different users of the system may have different views and requirements regarding what constitutes an acceptable trade-off, or they may need to experiment with different goal settings before the system starts exhibiting the desired behavior. In this paper the concept of numerical key performance indicators is 
applied to agent control and coordination in MASs. A software framework is presented which allows the user of a MAS to define at runtime numerical key performance indicators and quantitative objectives attached to them, which then are incorporated into the agents' individual goal systems in order to influence the local as well as global agent behavior. The central parts of the framework have been implemented as a Java programming library that facilitates the assessment and optimization of key performance indicators in MASs.},

abstract = {The efficiency of conventional centralised control in logistics is limited due to the complexity, the dynamics, and the distribution of logistics processes. The paradigm of autonomous logistics aims at overcoming these limitations by delegating decision-making to local logistics entities such as packages or containers. Represented by software agents, these entities must cooperate with each other to succeed in their logistics objectives. This paper introduces two interaction protocols for team formation of logistics entities. Which of them is adequate depends on the concrete application at hand. This decision is closely related with the limitations of autonomous logistics. One protocol aims at decreasing the communication effort, i.e., increasing the interaction efficiency. The other one aims at increasing the degree of decentralisation. This paper contributes a thorough investigation that supports system developers in choosing the right protocol for their demands.},

	glyphs accurately for the purpose of precise reproduction. On the

  abstract = {Supply network management is a challenging task due to the complexity,
	the dynamics, and the distribution of logistics processes. Automated
	process control thus requires to reduce the computational complexity
	and to cope with the dynamics locally. The paradigm of autonomous
	control in logistics means that control of logistics processes is
	delegated to the participating objects. As an example, shipping containers
	may themselves plan and schedule their way through logistics networks
	in accordance with objectives imposed by their owners. This work
	(Schuldt, 2010) solves the implementation of autonomous control with
	multiagent technology. This multiagent-based solution has been used
	in a realistic simulation of the container logistics processes of
	a major European retailer of consumer products. The validation shows
	that autonomous control is actually possible and that it outperforms
	the previous centralised dispatching approach by significantly increasing
	the resource utilisation efficiency. Moreover, the multiagent system
	relieves human dispatchers from dealing with standard cases, giving
	them more time to solve exceptional cases appropriately.},

	experience and report design constraint violations by means of real-time
	self-monitoring. Specialized electronic components and computational
	algorithms are needed to derive meaning from the combined signals

	may soon become one, forming a sensorial material. Current simulation
	techniques capture many aspects of sensor networks and structures.
	For decision making and communication, the intelligent agent paradigm
	is an accepted approach, as is finite element analysis for structural
	behavior. To gain knowledge how sensorial structures can most effectively
	be built, an artificial intelligence based process for the design
	of such structures was developed that uses machine learning methods
	for fast load inference. It is presented in this paper, along with

abstract = {Manifold approaches exist in the field of similarity-based shape retrieval. Although many of them achieve good results in reference tests, there has been less focus on systematically examining the factors influencing both retrieval performance and computational effort. Such an investigation, however, is important for the structured development and improvement of shape descriptors. This paper contributes a thorough investigation of the influence of the shape part-order and approximation precision. Firstly, two shape descriptors based on qualitative spatial relations are introduced and evaluated. These descriptors are particularly suited for the intended investigation because their only distinction is that one of them preserves the part-order, the other abandons it. Secondly, the recall and precision values are related to the degree of approximation in three-dimensional recall-precision-approximation diagrams. This helps choose an appropriate approximation precision. Finally, it turns out that 
remarkable retrieval results can be achieved even if only qualitative position information is considered.},

abstract = {Autonomous control in logistics decreases the computational effort for process control by problem decomposition. To this end, decision-making is delegated to the participating logistics entities. The more process control is decentralised the more interaction effort arises for coordinating the participants for efficient resource utilisation. This increase in interaction effort might even outweigh the decrease in computational effort gained by decomposition. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the interaction effort by adequate organisational structures. Team formation as a prerequisite for establishing these structures, however, also requires interaction effort. Hence, this chapter analytically narrows the optimal degree at which autonomous control is applied by the interaction effort arising for individual and team action as well as team formation.},

This paper identifies logistics planning and control as a promising application for clouds. However, two prerequisites must be met for cloud-based logistics control. Firstly, the platform-as-a-service layer must provide a synchronisation of the physically distributed real-world material flows and the data flows in the cloud. Secondly, appropriate and scalable control software must be implemented on the software-as-a-service layer. Apart from outlining the technical foundations, this paper describes how both steps enable a business model that is usually referred to as fourth-party logistics.},

  abstract = {Document enhancement tools are a valuable help in the study of historic
	documents. Given proper filter settings, many effects that impair
	the legibility can be evened out (e.g. washed out ink, stained and
	yellowed paper). However, because of differing authors, languages,
	handwritings, fonts and paper conditions, no single filter parameter
	set fits all documents. Therefore, the parameters are usually tuned
	in a time-consuming manual process to every individual document.
	To simplify this procedure, this paper introduces a classifier for
	the legibility of an enhanced historic text document. Experiments
	on the binarisation of a set of documents from 1938 to 1946 show

	In Robotics they are ubiquitious in self localisation and mapping
	(SLAM), object tracking and recognition. However, the length of the
	descriptor is a major obstacle for realtime applications and mobile
	platforms where the computation time and storage capacity is limited.
	It has also been shown that the high-dimensional SIFT descriptors
	suffer from a numerical instability known as the curse of dimensionality.
	Therefore, we investigate low bit-rate representations based on a
	binarisation of SIFT and SURF features. Our method is able to reduce
	the descriptor length by a factor of 8?32 and lifts the curse of
	dimensionality. The new descriptor is tested in a series of robotics
	related experiments, namely stereo analysis and object tracking under
	outdoor conditions, as well as image recognition. Our experiments
	show that the new representation is not only extremely compact, but
	also yields faster, more accurate and more robust results.},

              systems and currently under active development here at Bonn. Robotic systems, particularly
              autonomous robotic systems, present both challenges and opportunities to the implementors of their
              vision systems. On the one hand, robotic systems constrain the vision systems in terms of their
              available resources and in the specific form of the hardware to be employed. On the other hand,
              intelligent processes can employ sensory input to modify the image capture and image processing to
              fit the current context of the robot. RECIPE meets these challenges while facilitating the modular
              development of efficient image processing operations. Implementing all of its functionality
              within a platform and compiler neutral framework as scriptable, active objects which are
              dynamically loaded at run-time, RECIPE provides a common basis for the development of image
              processing systems on robots. At the same time, it permits the image processing operations being
              employed by the robot system to be monitored and adjusted according to all of the sensory
              information available to the robot, encouraging the deployment of efficient, context specific,
              algorithms. Finally, it has been designed to encourage robust, fault-tolerant approaches to the
              action of image processing.}

              It also requires them to act flexibly: to exploit opportunities and avoid problems as they occur.
              Scheduling activities to meet these requirements is an important research problem in its own right.
              In addition, it provides us with a problem domain where modern symbolic AI planning techniques can
              enable robots to exhibit better performance than they possibly could without planning. This paper
              describes PPSD, a novel planning technique that enables autonomous robots to impose order
              constraints on concurrent percept-driven plans to increase the plans' efficiency. The basic idea is
              to generate a schedule under simplified conditions and then to iteratively detect, diagnose, and
              eliminate behavior flaws caused by the schedule based on a small number of randomly sampled
              symbolic execution scenarios. The paper discusses the integration of PPSD into the controller of

              compute a series of different solutions for a given problem and converge into a periodical sequence

              traveling salesman problem. Our network model is able to compute multiple solutions and can use its
              dynamics to leave local minima in which classical models would be stuck. For adapting the model, we
              introduce a suitable network architecture and show how to encode the problem directly into the

  abstract = {This work describes new concepts for the object-oriented modeling and representation of
              time-varying image and sensor data sequences as well as the functions which process these data
              sequences. Different frameworks for developing sensor data modules from function and data objects
              are presented. These allow to develop, configure and control these modules easily and to integrate
              them into complex real-time program systems transparently as logical sensors. The aim of this work
              is to provide a software system which supports the design and implementation process of efficient
              and scalable program components and applications for real-time processing of image sequences and
              distributed sensor data analysis on standard computer systems. One of the fundamentals of this work
              is a consistent, explicit modeling of time. This concerns the sensor based data capturing and
              modeling of the outer process as well as the description of the data processing system itself. The
              first aspect allows to relate the data to the course of events in the real world and to model the
              dynamic aspects of the scene, the latter provides mechanisms for analysing the performance of the
              data processing methods. Data sequences are modelled as autonomous objects ('Sequence') collecting
              the individual measurements of a specific scene state like images or other sensor data, and the
              features derived from these. In addition, they represent general properties and methods, which are
              common for all kinds of data sequences, such as data initialization, access to current and old
              values, access to their temporal properties, and methods for updating the data sequence or
              interpolating values. Sensors and operators are modelled as 'Functor' objects, which on an abstract
              level provide the functionality for continuously capturing, transforming, or analysing the dynamic
              data sequences. They encapsulate concrete sensor integrations and operator sequences including
              their static parameters. In addition, they represent general, application independent operator
              properties, e.g., connections to the input and output data sequences, attributes and methods for
              analysing the time consumption, or a general interface for the cyclic operator execution. With the
              help of these Sequence and Functor objects the data flow representation of a sensor data module is
              easy to implement without the need for an explicit program control specificaton. Instead, the
              program components are locally executed by new input data or by access to the output data. That
              behavior can be modified according to topical requirements. It can be controlled by software
              agents. So, it is easy to adapt the program control and the level of concurrency. The presented
              concepts were prototyped as C++ class library, which provides a framework for the representation of
              data Sequences, Functors, software agents, and temporal expressions. Based on this library an
              extensive distributed robotic application - a team of soccer playing robots - was developed and
              succesfully employed and tested at different international RoboCup competitions.}

              continuous navigation behavior and represents the learned structure as compact and transparent

              given task. Compactness is achieved by incorporating only subplans that achieve significant
              performance gains. The resulting plans support action planning and opportunistic task execution.
              XfrmLearn is implemented and extensively evaluated on an autonomous mobile robot.}

              their plans as the environmental conditions or their tasks change. This raises the problem of
              deciding whether, when, where, and how to revise the plans as the robots' beliefs change. This
              article investigates an approach to execution time plan management in which the plans themselves
              specify the plan adaptation processes. In this approach the robot makes strategical (farsighted)
              adaptations while it executes a plan using tactical (immediate) decisions and overwrites tactical
              adaptations after strategical decisions have been reached (if necessary). We present experiments in
              which the plan adaptation technique is used for the control of two autonomous mobile robots. In one
              of them it controlled the course of action of a museums tourguide robot that has operated for
              thirteen days and performed about 3200 plan adaptations reliably.}

             model to the object contour in the image. The initial prior of the object pose is iteratively
             refined to the posterior distribution by optimizing the separation of the object and the background.
             The local separation criteria are based on local statistics which are iteratively computed from the
             object and the background region. No prior knowledge on color distributions is needed. Experiments
             show that the method is capable of localizing objects in a cluttered and textured scene even under
             strong variations of illumination. The method is able to localize a soccer ball within frame rate.}

This cooperation between the robots enables them to track temporarily occluded objects and to faster recover their position after they have lost track of it. The method is empirically validated based on experiments with a team of physical robots.}

  abstract = {The task of fitting parametric curve models to the boundaries of perceptually meaningful image
              regions is a key problem in computer vision with numerous applications, such as image segmentation,
              pose estimation, object tracking, and 3-D reconstruction. In this article, we propose the
              Contracting Curve Density (CCD) algorithm as a solution to the curve-fitting problem. The CCD
              algorithm extends the state-of-the-art in two important ways. First, it applies a novel likelihood
              function for the assessment of a fit between the curve model and the image data. This likelihood
              function can cope with highly inhomogeneous image regions, because it is formulated in terms of
              local image statistics. The local image statistics are learned on the fly from the vicinity of the
              expected curve. They provide therefore locally adapted criteria for separating the adjacent image
              regions. These local criteria replace often used predefined fixed criteria that rely on homogeneous
              image regions or specific edge properties. The second contribution is the use of blurred curve
              models as efficient means for iteratively optimizing the posterior density over possible model
              parameters. These blurred curve models enable the algorithm to trade-off two conflicting
              objectives, namely heaving a large area of convergence and achieving high accuracy. We apply the
              CCD algorithm to several challenging image segmentation and 3-D pose estimation problems. Our
              experiments with RGB images show that the CCD algorithm achieves a high level of robustness and
              subpixel accuracy even in the presence of severe texture, shading, clutter, partial occlusion, and
              strong changes of illumination.}}

              comprises the positions and dynamic states of the robot itself and its teammates as well as the
              positions of the ball and the opponent players. Employing sophisticated probabilistic reasoning
              techniques and exploiting the cooperation between team mates, the robot can estimate complex game
              states reliably and accurately despite incomplete and inaccurate state information. The action

              plan-based autonomous robot controllers that perform, beyond doubt, better than they possibly could
              without applying AI methods. One of the main reason for this situation is abstraction. AI based
              control techniques typically abstract away from the mechanisms that generate the physical behavior
              and refuse the use of control structures that have proven to be necessary for producing flexible
              and reliable robot behavior. The consequence is: AI-based control mechanisms can neither explain
              and diagnose how a certain behavior resulted from a given plan nor can they revise the plans to
              improve its physical performance. In our view, a substantial improvement on this situation is not
              possible without having a new generation of robot control languages. These languages must, on the
              one hand, be expressive enough for specifying and producing high performance robot behavior and, on
              the other hand, be transparent and explicit enough to enable execution time inference mechanisms to
              reason about, and manipulate these control programs. This paper reports on aspects of the design of
              RPL-II, which we propose as such a next generation control language. We describe the nuts and bolts
              of extending our existing language R P L to support explicit models of physical systems, and
              object-oriented modeling of control tasks and programs. We show the application of these concepts

              drags behind those of the respective hand-coded ones. In our view,
              this situation is caused not mainly by deficiencies of the learning
              algorithms but rather by an insufficient embedding of learning in
              robot control programs.
              This paper presents a case study in which RoLL, a robot control
              language that allows for explicit representations of learning
              problems, is applied to learning robot navigation tasks. The case
              study shows that RoLL's constructs for specifying learning
              problems (1) make aspects of autonomous robot learning explicit
              and controllable; (2) have an enormous impact on the
              performance of the learned controllers and therefore encourage the
              engineering of high performance learners; (3) make the learning
              processes repeatable and allow for writing bootstrapping robot
              controllers.  Taken together the approach constitutes an important

                       comprehensive and heterogeneous ubiquitous computing
                       applications is hindered by the lack of a
                       comprehensive middleware infrastructure: interfaces
                       to sensors are company specific and sometimes even
                       product specific.  Typically, these interfaces also

                       community, as the backbone of a heterogeneous
                       ubiquitous system.  Player/Stage offers many features
                       needed in ubicomp, mostly because dealing with
                       uncertainty and many different sensor and actuator
                       systems has been a long term problem in robotics as

Humans are good at cooperation in shared workspaces, because they anticipate and adapt to the intentions and actions of others. In contrast, multi-agent and multi-robot systems rely on communication to exchange their intentions. This causes problems in domains where perfect communication is not guaranteed, such as rescue robotics, autonomous vehicles participating in traffic, or robotic soccer.

  In this paper, we introduce a computational model for implicit coordination, and apply it to a typical coordination task from robotic soccer: regaining ball possession. The computational model specifies that performance prediction models are necessary for coordination, so we learn them off-line from observed experience. By taking the perspective of the team mates, these models are then used to predict utilities of others, and optimize a shared performance model for joint actions. In several experiments conducted with our robotic soccer team, we evaluate the performance of implicit coordination.}

A promising approach to solve this problem is to provide agents with reflective capabilities. Agents that can reflect on the effects and expected performance of their actions, are more aware and knowledgeable of their capabilities and shortcomings.

  In this paper, we introduce a computational model for what we call \emph{action awareness}. To achieve this awareness, agents learn predictive action models from observed experience. This knowledge is then used to optimize, transform and coordinate plans. We apply this computational model to a number of typical scenarios from robotic soccer. Various experiments on real robots demonstrate that action awareness enables the robots to improve the performance of their plans substantially.}

  In motor control, high-level goals must be expressed in terms of low-level
  motor commands. An effective approach to bridge this gap, widespread in both
  nature and robotics, is to acquire a set of temporally extended actions, each
  designed for specific goals and task contexts. An action selection module then
  selects the appropriate action in a given situation. In this approach,
  high-level goals are mapped to actions, and actions produce streams of motor
  commands. The first mapping is often ambiguous, as several actions or action
  parameterizations can achieve the same goal. Instead of choosing an arbitrary
  action or parameterization, the robot should select those that best fulfill
  some pre-specified requirement, such as minimal execution duration, successful
  execution, or coordination of actions with others.

  The key to being able to perform this selection lies in prediction. By
  predicting the performance of different actions and action parameterizations,
  the robot can also predict which of them best meets the requirement. Action
  models, which have many similarities with human forward models, enable robots
  to make such predictions.

  In this dissertation, we introduce a computational model for the acquisition
  and application of action models. Robots first learn action models from
  observed experience, and then use them to optimize their performance with the
  following methods: 1)~\emph{Subgoal refinement}, which enables robots to
  optimize actions in action sequences by predicting which action
  parameterization leads to the best performance. 2)~\emph{Condition refinement}
  and \emph{subgoal assertion}, with which robots can adapt existing actions to
  novel task contexts and goals by predicting when action execution will fail.
  3)~\emph{Implicit coordination}, in which multiple robots globally coordinate
  their actions, by locally making predictions about the performance of other
  robots. The acquisition and applications of action models have been realized
  and empirically evaluated in three robotic domains: the \pioneer robots of our
  RoboCup mid-size league team, a simulated B21 in a kitchen environment, and a
  PowerCube robot arm.

  The main principle behind this approach is that in robot controller design,
  knowledge that robots learn themselves from observed experience complements
  well the abstract knowledge that humans specify.

  This paper proposes GrAM (Grounded Action Models), a novel
  integration of actions and action models into the knowledge
  representation and inference mechanisms of agents. In GrAM action
  models accord to agent behavior and can be specified explicitly and implicitly.  The
  explicit representation is an action class specific set of Markov
  logic rules that predict action properties. Stated implicitly an
  action model defines a data mining problem that, when executed,
  computes the model's explicit representation. When inferred from
  an implicit representation the prediction rules predict typical
  behavior and are learned from a set of training examples, or, in
  other words, grounded in the respective experience of the agents.
  Therefore, GrAM allows for the functional and thus adaptive specification of concepts
  such as the class of situations in which a special action is typically
  executed successfully or the concept of agents that tend to execute certain
  kinds of actions.

  GrAM represents actions and their models using an upgrading of the representation
  language OWL and equips the Java Theorem Prover (JTP), a hybrid reasoner for OWL, with
  additional mechanisms that allow for the automatic acquisition of
  action models and solving a variety of inference tasks for actions, action models and functional descriptions.

One of the most notable and recognizable features of robot motion is the abrupt
transitions between actions in action sequences. In contrast, humans and animals
perform sequences of actions efficiently, and with seamless transitions between
subsequent actions. This smoothness is not a goal in itself, but a side-effect
of the evolutionary optimization of other performance measures.


In this paper, we argue that such jagged motion is an inevitable consequence of
the way human designers and planners reason about abstract actions. We then
present subgoal refinement, a procedure that optimizes action sequences. Subgoal
refinement determines action parameters that are not relevant to why the action
was selected, and optimizes these parameters with respect to expected execution
performance. This performance is computed using action models, which are learned
from observed experience. We integrate subgoal refinement in an existing
planning system, and demonstrate how requiring optimal performance causes smooth
motion in three robotic domains.

  abstract = {Robots performing complex tasks in changing, everyday environments and required to improve
with experience must continually monitor the way they execute their routines and revise them
if necessary. Existing approaches, which use either monolithic or isolated, nonrecurring
learning processes, cannot sufficiently focus their learning processes to satisfy these
requirements. To meet this challenge we propose to make learning an integral part of the
control program by providing a control language that includes constructs for specifying
and executing learning problems.

Our Robot Learning Language (RoLL) makes learning tasks executable within the control program.
It allows for the specification of complete learning processes including the acquisition of
experience, the execution of learning algorithms and the integration of learning results into
the program. RoLL is built upon the concept of experience, which is a learning task specific
symbolic summary of a problem solving episode. This means that experiences do not only record
the observed data, but also include the robot's intentions and the perceived execution context.
The experience acquisition in RoLL is designed in a way that experiences can be defined outside
the primary control program, using hybrid automata as a tool for declaratively specifying
experience and anchoring it to the program. The rich experience concept enables convenient
abstraction and an economic use of experiences. RoLL's design allows the inclusion of arbitrary
experience-based learning algorithms. Upon the completion of the learning process RoLL
automatically integrates the learned function into the control program without interrupting
Program Execution.

RoLL enables the plug-and-play addition of new learning problems and keeps the control program
modular and transparent. RoLL's control structures make learning an integral part of the
control program and can serve as a powerful implementational platform for comprehensive
learning approaches such as developmental, life-long and imitation learning.}

  abstract =     {A common approach to the problem of 3D human pose estimation from video
                  is to recursively estimate the most likely pose via particle filtering.
                  However, standard particle filtering methods fail the task due to the high
                  dimensionality of the 3D articulated human pose space.
                  In this paper we present a thorough evaluation of two variants of particle
                  filtering, namely Annealed Particle Filtering and Partitioned Sampling
                  Particle Filtering, that have been proposed to make the problem feasible by
                  exploiting the hierarchical structures inside the pose space. We evaluate
                  both methods in the context of markerless model-based 3D motion capture
                  using silhouette shapes from multiple cameras. For that we created a
                  simulation from ground truth sequences of human motions, which enables
                  us to focus our evaluation on the sampling capabilities of the approaches,
                  i.e. on how efficient particles are spread towards the modes of the
                  distribution. We show the behaviour with respect to the amount of cameras
                  used, the amount of particles used, as well as the dimensionality of the
                  search space. Especially the performance when using more complex human
                  models (40 DOF and above) that are able to capture human movements
                  with higher precision compared to previous approaches is of interest
                  in this work.
                  In summary, we show that both methods have complementary strengths, and
                  propose a combined method that is able to perform the tracking task with
                  higher robustness despite reduced computational effort.}

                  human motion capture using multiple cameras. We use an industry
                  proven anthropometric human model that was modeled taking ergonomic
                  considerations into account. The outer surface consists of a precise
                  yet compact 3D surface mesh that is mostly rigid on body part level
                  apart from some small but important torsion deformations. Benefits
                  are the ability to capture a great amount of possible human
                  appearances with high accuracy while still having a simple to use
                  and computationally efficient model. We have introduced special
                  optimizations such as caching into the model to improve its
                  performance in tracking applications. Available force and comfort
                  measures within the model provide further opportunities for future
                  research.
                  3D articulated pose estimation is performed in a Bayesian framework,
                  using a set of hierarchically coupled local particle filters for
                  tracking. This makes it possible to sample efficiently from the high
                  dimensional space of articulated human poses without constraining
                  the allowed movements. Sequences of tracked upper-body as well as
                  full-body motions captured by three cameras show promising results.
                  Despite the high dimensionality of our model (51 DOF) we succeed
                  at tracking using only silhouette overlap as weighting function
                  due to the precise outer appearance of our model and the
                  hierarchical decomposition.}

               In this paper we present our work on human action recognition in intelligent
               environments. We classify actions by looking at a time-sequence of
               silhouettes extracted from various camera images. By treating time as the
               third spatial dimension we generate so-called space-time shapes that contain
               rich information about the actions. We propose a novel approach for
               recognizing actions, by representing the shapes as 3D point clouds and
               estimating feature histograms for them. Preliminary results show that our
               method robustly derives different classes of actions, even in the presence
               of large variability in the data, coming from different persons at different
               time intervals.

To do so effectively, motor control systems must reason about actions at different levels of abstraction. Grounding high-level plans in low-level actions is essential semantic knowledge for plan-based control of real robots.

We present a robot control system that uses declarative, procedural and predictive to generate, execute and optimize plans. Declarative knowledge is represented in PDDL, durative actions constitute procedural knowledge, and predictive knowledge is learned by observing action executions. We demonstrate how learned predictive knowledge enables robots to autonomously optimize plan execution with respect to execution duration and robustness in real-time. The approach is evaluated in two different robotic domains.}

               Our goal is to develop intelligent service robots that operate in standard
               human environments, automating common tasks.  In pursuit of this goal, we
               follow the ubiquitous robotics paradigm, in which intelligent
               perception and control are combined with ubiquitous computing. By
               exploiting sensors and effectors in its environment, a robot can perform
               more complex tasks without becoming overly complex itself.  Following this
               insight, we have developed a service robot that operates autonomously in a
               sensor-equipped kitchen.  The robot learns from demonstration and performs
               sophisticated tasks in concert with the network of devices in its
               environment.  We report on the design, implementation, and usage of this
               system, which is freely available for use and improvement by others in the
               research community.

               This paper proposes a novel way of characterizing the local geometry of 3D
               points, using persistent feature histograms. The relationships between the
               neighbors of a point are analyzed and the resulted values are stored in a
               16-bin histogram. The histograms are pose and point cloud density invariant
               and cope well with noisy datasets. We show that geometric primitives have
               unique signatures in this feature space, preserved even in the presence of
               additive noise. To extract a compact subset of points which characterizes a
               point cloud dataset, we perform an in-depth analysis of all point feature
               histograms using different distance metrics. Preliminary results show that
               point clouds can be roughly segmented based on the uniqueness of geometric
               primitives feature histograms. We validate our approach on datasets acquired.
               from laser sensors in indoor (kitchen) environments.

  abstract = {One of the oldest dreams of Artificial Intelligence is the realization of autonomous robots
that achieve a level of problem-solving competency comparable to humans. Human
problem-solving capabilities are particularly impressive in the context of everyday ac-
tivities such as performing household chores: people are able to deal with ambiguous and
incomplete information, they adapt their plans to different environments and specific sit-
uations achieving intuitively almost optimal behavior, they cope with interruptions and
failures and manage multiple interfering jobs. The investigations presented in this work
make substantial progress in the direction of building robots that show similar behavior.

This thesis addresses the problem of competently accomplishing everyday manipu-
lation activities, such as setting the table and preparing meals, as a plan-based control
problem. In plan-based control, robots do not only execute their programs but also reason
about and modify them. We propose TRANER (Transformational Planner) as a suitable
planning system for the optimization of everyday manipulation activities. TRANER real-
izes planning through a generate-test cycle in which plan revision rules propose alternative
plans and new plans are simulated in order to test and evaluate them. The unique features
of TRANER are that it can realize very general and abstract plan revisions such as "stack
objects before carrying them instead of handling them one by one" and that it successfully
operates on plans in a way that they generate reliable, flexible, and efficient robot behavior
in realistic simulations.

The key contributions of this dissertation are threefold. First, it extends the plan rep-
resentation to support the specification of robust and transformable plans. Second, it pro-
poses a library of general and flexible plans for a household robot, using the extended
plan representation. Third, it establishes a powerful, yet intuitive syntax for transforma-
tion rules together with a set of general transformation rules for optimizing pick-and-place
tasks in an everyday setting using the rule language.

The viability and strength of the approach is empirically demonstrated in comprehen-
sive and extensive experiments in a simulation environment with realistically simulated
action and sensing mechanisms. The experiments show that transformational planning is
necessary to tailor the robot's activities and that it is capable of substantially improving
the robot's performance.}

              when performing more and more complex tasks. They must be able to recognize
              objects, know what they are and how they can be used. This knowledge can
              often be specified more easily in terms of action-related concepts than by
              giving declarative descriptions of the appearance of objects. Defining chairs
              as objects to sit on, for instance, is much more natural than describing
              how chairs in general look like.
              Having grounded symbolic models of its actions and related concepts allows
              the robot to reason about its activities and improve its problem solving
              performance.
              In order to use action-related concepts, the robot must be able to find them in its
              environment. We present a practical approach to robot knowledge representation that
              combines description logics knowledge bases with data mining and (self-) observation
              modules. The robot collects experiences while executing actions and uses them to
              learn models and aspects of action-related concepts grounded in its perception and
              action system.
              We demonstrate our approach by learning places that are involved in mobile
              robot manipulation actions.}

              Our approach applies AI planning techniques to transform default
              plans that can be inferred from instructions for activities of daily
              life into flexible, high-performance robot plans. To find high
              performance plans the planning system applies transformations such
              as carrying plates to the table by stacking them or leaving cabinet doors
              open while setting the table, which require substantial changes of
              the control structure of the intended activities.

              We argue and demonstrate that applying AI planning techniques
              directly to concurrent reactive plan languages, instead of using
              layered software architectures with different languages, enables the
              robot action planner to achieve substantial performance improvements
              (23\% - 45\% depending on the tasks). We also argue that the
              transformation of concurrent reactive plans is necessary to obtain
              the results. Our claims are supported by extensive empirical
              investigations in realistic simulations.}

                   manipulation purposes. Instead of having only a local database
                   containing already seen objects, we want to use shared databases
                   available over the internet. This approach while having the
                   potential to dramatically increase the visual recognition capability
                   of robots, also poses certain problems, like wrong annotation due to
                   the open nature of the database, or overwhelming amounts of data
                   (many 3D models) or the lack of  relevant data (no models matching a
                   specified label). To solve those problems we propose the following:
                   First, we present an outlier/inlier classification method for
                   reducing the number of results and discarding invalid 3D models that
                   do not match our query. Second, we utilize an approach from computer
                   graphics, the so called 'morphing', to this application to
                   specialize the models, in order to describe more objects. Third, we
                   search for 3D models using a restricted search space, as obtained
                   from our knowledge of the environment. We show our classification
                   and matching results and finally show how we can recover the correct
                   scaling with the stereo setup of our robot.}

We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Resampling Particle Filter (RBRPF) as an implementable real-time continuation of a state-of-the-art multi-target tracking method. Target configurations are tracked by sampling associations and solving single-target tracking problems by Kalman filters. As an advantage of the new method the independence assumption between data associations is relaxed to increase the robustness in the sports domain. Smart resampling and memoization is introduced to equip the tracking method with real-time capabilities in the first place. The probabilistic framework allows for consideration of appearance models and the fusion of different sensors. We demonstrate its applicability to real world applications by tracking soccer players captured by multiple cameras through occlusions in real-time.

MGNG combines the state-of-the-art recursive temporal context of Merge Neural Gas (MNG) with the incremental Growing Neural Gas (GNG) and enables thereby the analysis of unbounded and possibly infinite time series in an online manner.
There is no need to define the number of neurons a priori and only constant parameters are used. In order to focus on frequent sequence patterns an entropy maximization strategy is utilized which controls the creation of new neurons.
Experimental results demonstrate reduced time complexity compared to MNG while retaining similar accuracy in time series representation.

The method is an instance of Sequential Importance Resampling filters approximating the posterior of complete target configurations as a mixture of Gaussians. Using predicted target positions by Kalman filters, data associations are sampled for each measurement sweep according to their likelihood allowing to constrain the number of associations per target. Updated target configurations are weighted for resampling pursuant to their explanatory power for former positions and measurements. Fixed-lag of the resulting positions increases the tracking quality while smart resampling and memoization decrease the computational demand. A negative information handling exploits missing measurements for a target outside the monitored area.
We present both, qualitative and quantitative experimental results on two demanding real-world applications with occluded and highly confusable targets, demonstrating the robustness and real-time performance of our approach outperforming current state-of-the-art MCMC methods.

            notions in such games and probabilistically derived from a
            set of previous games. In contrast to existing approaches, automated

            context-sensitive concepts are instantiated by the application of machine learning techniques.

                We present a practical approach to robot knowledge representation that
                combines description logics knowledge bases with a rich environment model,

                models of action-related concepts grounded in its perception and action system.
                We demonstrate our approach by learning places that are involved in mobile
                robot manipulation actions, by locating objects based on their function

                   objects in human environments with special application to our Assistive Kitchen.
                   However, the open and free nature of such databases pose problems for example the presence of
                   incorrectly annotated 3D models, or objects for which very few models
                   exist online. We have previously proposed techniques to automatically select
                   the useful models from the search result, and utilizing such models to
                   perform simple manipulation tasks. Here, we build upon that work, to describe a technique
                   based on Morphing to form new 3D models if we only have a few models corresponding to a label.
                   However, morphing in computer graphics requires a human operator and is computationally burdensome,
                   due to which we present our own automatic morphing technique. We also present a simple
                   technique to speed the matching process of 3D models against real scenes using Visibility culling.
                   This technique can potentially speed-up the matching process by 2-3 times while using less memory,

                behavior generated by a plan in order to improve the robot's
                performance substantially.

                In this paper we investigate the high-fidelity temporal projection
                of realistic robot behavior based on physics- and sensor-based
                simulation systems. We equip a simulator and interpreter with means
                to log simulated plan executions into a database. A logic-based
                query and inference mechanism then retrieves and reconstructs the
                necessary information from the database and translates the
                information into a first-order representation of robot plans and the
                behavior they generate.  The query language enables the robot
                planning system to infer the intentions, the beliefs, and the world
                state at any projected time.  It also allows the planning system to
                recognize, diagnose, and analyze various plan failures typical for
                performing everyday manipulation tasks. }}

  abstract =     {  We present a markerless tracking system for unconstrained human
  motions which are typical for everyday manipulation tasks. Our
  system is capable of tracking a high-dimensional human model
  (51 DOF) without constricting the type of motion and the need for
  training sequences. The system reliably tracks humans that
  frequently interact with the environment, that manipulate objects,
  and that can be partially occluded by the environment.
  We describe and discuss two key components that substantially
  contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the system. First, a
  sophisticated hierarchical sampling strategy for recursive Bayesian
  estimation that combines partitioning with annealing strategies to enable
  efficient search in the presence of many local maxima. Second, a simple yet
  effective appearance model that allows for the combination of shape and
  appearance masks to implicitly deal with two cases of environmental occlusions
  by (1) subtracting dynamic non-human objects from the region of
  interest and (2) modeling objects (e.g. tables) that both occlude and
  can be occluded by human subjects.  The appearance model is based on
  bit representations that makes our algorithm well suited for
  implementation on highly parallel hardware such as commodity GPUs.
  Extensive evaluations on the HumanEva2 benchmarks show the potential
  of our method when compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian techniques.
  Besides the HumanEva2 benchmarks, we present results on more
  challenging sequences, including table setting tasks in a kitchen
  environment and persons getting into and out of a car mock-up.}

We provide the original video sequences, fullbody motion capture data recorded by a markerless motion tracker, RFID tag readings and magnetic sensor readings from objects and the environment, as well as corresponding action labels. In this paper, we both describe how the data was computed, in particular the motion tracker and the labeling, and give examples what it can be used for. We present first results of an automatic method for segmenting the observed motions into semantic classes, and describe how the data can be integrated in a knowledge-based framework for reasoning about the observations.},

  classification and the assessment of actions and situations objective
  and can justify the probabilistic interpretation with respect to the
  activities the concepts have been learned from.

  Data streams are time-sequences of silhouettes extracted from cameras in the environment.
  From the 2D silhouette contours we generate space-time streams by continuously aligning and
  stacking the contours along the time axis as third spatial dimension.
  The space-time stream of an observation sequence is segmented into parts
  corresponding to subactions using a pattern matching technique based
  on suffix trees and interval scheduling.  Then, the segmented space-time shapes
  are processed by treating the shapes as 3D point clouds and estimating global
  point feature histograms for them. The resultant models are clustered using
  statistical analysis, and our experimental results indicate that the presented
  methods robustly derive different action classes. This holds despite large
  intra-class variance in the recorded datasets due to performances from different
  persons at different time intervals.

A fundamental issue is the compact and precise declaration of such problems. We propose Markov logic networks (MLNs), a representation formalism well-known from statistical relational learning, as a simple yet highly expressive modelling framework, for MLNs enable the representation of general principles that abstract away from concrete entities in order to achieve a separation between the model and the data to which it is applied. MLNs provide the full power of first-order logic and combine it with probabilistic semantics, thus allowing a flexible representation of soft constraints. We introduce an automatic conversion of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference problems in MLNs to weighted constraint satisfaction problems to leverage a large body of available solving methods, and we make our software suite available to the public. We demonstrate the soundness of our approach on a real-world room allocation problem, providing experimental results.}

abstract={This paper investigates the inside-out recognition of everyday manipulation tasks using a gaze-directed camera, which is a camera that actively directs at the visual attention focus of the person wearing the camera. We present EYEWATCHME, an integrated vision and state estimation system that at the same time tracks the positions and the poses of the acting hands, the pose that the manipulated object, and the pose of the observing camera. Taken together, EYEWATCHME provides comprehensive data for learning predictive models of vision-guided manipulation that include the objects people are attending, the interaction of attention and reaching/grasping, and the segmentation of reaching and grasping using visual attention as evidence. Key technical contributions of this paper include an ego view hand tracking system that estimates 27 DOF hand poses. The hand tracking system is capable of detecting hands and estimating their poses despite substantial self-occlusion caused by the hand and occlusions caused by the manipulated object. EYEWATCHME can also cope with blurred images that are caused by rapid eye movements. The second key contribution is the of the integrated activity recognition system that simultaneously tracks the attention of the person, the hand poses, and the poses of the manipulated objects in terms of a global scene coordinates. We demonstrate the operation of EYEWATCHME in the context of kitchen tasks including filling a cup with water.},

    abstract = {Tracking multiple targets with similar appearance is a common task in many computer vision applications as surveillance or sports analysis. We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Resampling Particle Filter (RBRPF) as a real-time multi-target tracking method that solves the data association problem by a Monte Carlo approach. Each particle containing the whole target configuration is predicted by using a process model and resampled by sampling associations and fusing of the predicted state with the assigned measurement(s) instead of the common dispersion. As each target state is modeled as a Gaussian, Rao-Blackwellization can be used to solve some of these steps analytically. The sampling of associations splits the multi-target tracking problem in multiple single target tracking problems, which can be handled by Kalman filters in an optimal way. The method is independent of the order of measurements which is mostly predetermined by the measuring process in contrast to other state-of-the-art approaches. Smart resampling and memoization is introduced to equip the tracking method with real-time capabilities in the first place exploiting the discreteness of the associations. The probabilistic framework allows for consideration of appearance models and the fusion of different sensors. A way to constrain the multiplicity of measurements associated with a single target is proposed and -- along with the ability to cope with a high number of targets in clutter -- evaluated in a simulation experiment. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to real world applications by tracking soccer players captured by multiple cameras through occlusions in real-time.}

The aim was to examine the potential of using a computer-game-like simulation for user studies on cognition, in particular for robot-centred studies on human-robot interaction, but also other areas such as studies about context-specific and context-independent behaviour. A simulation allows the creation of a large number of environments at low cost and enables comparisons of behaviour in reality and simulation. In the present pilot study we have considered three points of interest: 1) the differences in user skills with the used simulation, 2) comparison of human behaviour in simulation and reality performing everyday activities, and 3) comparison of behaviour in different simulated environments.}}

  abstract = {This document describes the current state of implementation of the RoboEarth representation language. This language is designed for two main purposes. First, it should allow to represent all information a robot needs to perform a reasonably complex task. This includes information about (1) Plans, which consist of the actions a task is composed of, ordering constraints among them, monitoring and failure handling, as well as action parameters like objects, locations, grasp types; (2) Objects, especially types, dimensions, states, and other properties, but also locations of specific objects a robot has detected, and object models that can be used for recognition; and the (3) Environment, including maps for self-localization as well as poses of objects like pieces of furniture. The second main task of the RoboEarth language is to allow a robot to decide on its own if a certain piece of information is useful to it. That means, a robot must be able to check if an action description contains a plan for the action it would like to do, if it meets all requirements to perform this action, and if it has the sensors needed to use an object recognition model. Using the semantic descriptions in the RoboEarth language, a robot can perform the checks using logical inference.
